# Averi Wylie - Full Stack Developer | AI Enthusiast | Logical Problem Solver

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing a selection of coding projects demonstrating the information I have learned at laurier leading in my first two years. I hope to specialize in machine learning, and these are stepping stones in developing my logic to one day achieve that.

## About Me:

Full Stack Developer in my first years at laurier, completing my honours BSc in Computer Science degree. I've been programming since high school, where I originally learned C#, however, univseristies follow a python - c++ learning model these days, and as such, these projects are pythonic.
